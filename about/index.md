I am an advocate, facilitator, and collaborative professional in the open ecosystem. I am passionate about ensuring open technologies are accessible and understandable to library and archives staff at all levels. I advocate for user-centered technology, open community, and inclusive events. I pursue and promote open, equitable, and transparent communities.   

I'm the Outreach & Engagement Coordinator for services at <a href="https://lyrasis.org">LYRASIS</a>, and was formerly the Services Coordinator at <a href="https://duraspace.org">DuraSpace</a> before that organization merged with LYRASIS in July 2019. Iâ€™m also the Release Manager for <a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+7.0+Status">DSpace 7</a>, the largest release in DSpace history.  

Previously I was the Member Services Coordinator for <a href="https://nclive.org">NC LIVE</a>, a digital library consortium serving 201 academic and public libraries across North Carolina. I ensured that member needs were met through services including a Help Desk, staff training, communications, documentation, events, and outreach programs. 

I am active with the North Carolina Library Association and am a volunteer Guardian ad Litem. I'm a founding board member and volunteer coordinator for <a href="https://sundayassemblychapelhill.org">Sunday Assembly Chapel Hill</a>. When I'm not busy being an advocate of one sort or another I'm an avid gardener, resin artist, and drummer.
