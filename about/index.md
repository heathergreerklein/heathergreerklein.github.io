Hello! 

I'm an independent information professional and the Services Coordinator at <a href="http://duraspace.org">DuraSpace</a>. 

Previously I was the Member Services Coordinator for <a href="http://nclive.org">NC LIVE</a>, a digital library consortium serving 201 academic and public libraries across North Carolina. I ensured that member needs were met through services including a Help Desk, staff training, communications, documentation, events, and outreach programs. 

I am active with the North Carolina Library Association and serve on the Biannual Conference Planning Committee. I'm also an active community volunteer: I work as a volunteer Guardian ad Litem advocating on behalf of abused and neglected in Durham County, and I'm a founding board member and volunteer coordinator for <a href="http://sundayassemblychapelhill.org">Sunday Assembly Chapel Hill</a>. When I'm not busy being an advocate of one sort or another I'm an avid gardener and I love to travel, play the drums, and learn new skills.

## Current Interests:
* Community Engagement
* Membership Cooperatives
* Digital Repositories
* Digital Literacy
* Training & Development
* Host Leadership
