Hello! 

I'm Heather Greer Klein and I'm passionate about making digital resources and open technologies accessible and understandable to library and archives staff at all levels. I promote an empowerment-based training and support model and am an advocate for excellent user experiences. I'm a collaborative project manager and I love iterating and working for efficient and effective training and documentation that helps other library staff better serve the missions of their organizations.

I'm the Outreach & Engagement Coordinator for services at <a href="https://lyrasis.org">LYRASIS</a>, and was formerly the Services Coordinator at <a href="https://duraspace.org">DuraSpace</a> before that organization merged with LYRASIS in July 2019. 

Previously I was the Member Services Coordinator for <a href="http://nclive.org">NC LIVE</a>, a digital library consortium serving 201 academic and public libraries across North Carolina. I ensured that member needs were met through services including a Help Desk, staff training, communications, documentation, events, and outreach programs. 

I am active with the North Carolina Library Association and serve on the Biannual Conference Planning Committee. I'm also an active community volunteer: I work as a volunteer Guardian ad Litem advocating on behalf of abused and neglected in Durham County, and I'm a founding board member and volunteer coordinator for <a href="http://sundayassemblychapelhill.org">Sunday Assembly Chapel Hill</a>. When I'm not busy being an advocate of one sort or another I'm an avid gardener and I love to travel, play the drums, and learn new skills.

## Current Interests:
* Training & Development in Libraries
* Iterative and Collaborative Processes
* Open Technology in Libraries
* Host Leadership
