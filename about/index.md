I'm the Member Services Coordinator for <a href="http://nclive.org">NC LIVE</a>, a digital library consortium based at NC State University. In this role I manage the services we provide to our member library staff, including our Help Desk, training, communications, events, and outreach programs. I am active with the North Carolina Library Association and am a frequent presenter at library workshops and conferences across North Carolina.

I'm also an active community volunteer. I work as a volunteer Guardian ad Litem advocating for abused and neglected children in the Durham County Court System, and I'm also a founding board member and volunteer coordinator for <a href="http://sundayassemblychapelhill.org">Sunday Assembly Chapel Hill</a>. In my off time I'm an avid gardener, traveler, drummer, and learner.

## Current Interests:

* Community Engagement
