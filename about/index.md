Hello! I'm the Member Services Coordinator for <a href="http://nclive.org">NC LIVE</a>, a digital library consortium serving 201 academic and public libraries across the state. In this role I manage the services we provide to our member libraries' staff. I ensure that we are meeting our member's needs through our Help Desk, staff training, communications, documentation, events, and outreach programs. I am active with the North Carolina Library Association and am a frequent presenter at library workshops and conferences across North Carolina.

I'm also an active community volunteer: I work as a volunteer Guardian ad Litem advocating on behalf of children who have come into foster care in Durham County, and I'm a founding board member and volunteer coordinator for <a href="http://sundayassemblychapelhill.org">Sunday Assembly Chapel Hill</a>. In my off time I'm an avid gardener and I love to travel, play the drums, and learn new skills.

## Current Interests:
* Community Engagement
* Membership Cooperatives
* Digital Literacy
* Training & Development
* Host Leadership
