# About this site

Welcome! I built this site as a professional web presence and a simple portfolio---but it was also an excuse to learn the basics of GitHub, static websites, and [Markdown][df1].   

Special thanks to [Todd Stoffer][stoffer] and [Alison Blaine][blaine] from NC State University Libraries for creating the [Jekyll Academic][jekyllncsu] template and presenting it at the 2016 LAUNC-CH Conference.
