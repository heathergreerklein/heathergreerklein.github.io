I frequently present both in-person and online as part of workshops, training sessions, conference sessions, and panels. Many of these presentations have been added to [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/HeatherGreerKlein). 

Recorded webinars include ["DuraCloud: What's New and What's Next for the Software and the Service"](https://youtu.be/KSICFYf-qYI) and a presentation for the [National Digital Stewardship Alliance Infrastructure Interest Group Information Series](https://youtu.be/JiviyDF7iRo)   (beginning at 3:30).
